        <div class="p-2">
            <p>RivETH is an open source Ethereum smart contract development toolkit that runs in the browser. It is a tool built for smart contract developers, beginners and experts alike, to quickly prototype, deploy and interact with smart contracts, all within a web browser.</p>
            <p>After installation, RIvETH can be used offline, this provides an outlet for developers who do not want to use Remix online or have not fully started using foundry. With this being said, it should be noted that RivETH is not an alternative to tools like foundry, rather, it is a tool that provides an interface to deploy and interact with smart contracts before carrying out advanced tests and continuing the development process with foundry or Remix.</p>
